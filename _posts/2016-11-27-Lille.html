description1: One of my favourite people, Gemma, spent a semester abroad teaching English in France. We decided to meet up halfway between our homes in the pretty French city of Lille.
description2: We spent the day wandering, which is always the best way to see a city. It was all Christmassy and lovely.
description3: I would love to go back to Lille to see it in the summer and visit the zoo, because it was closed. It's so easy to get to, and I spent less than 50 euro on train tickets.
