description1: "We ventured out to the beautiful mountain town of Garmisch Partenkirchen for four nights of exploring and relaxation. It's right on the German-Austrian border, and sits under the shadow of Germany's highest peak. We stayed at an Alpine spa hotel, which was a first for us - but we loved having a pool and sauna to enjoy after long cold days outside!"
description2: "We went up the famous Zugspitze and spent all day up on top of the mountain; Tristan can't ski so we went toboganning, explored all the different areas, crossed the border into Austria, had hot chocolate, and got equally sunburnt and frostbitten. It was fab! I'm not a fan of cable cars  but we rode the cable car down, and survived intact! The cogwheel train up through the mountain is definitely the way to go though."
description3: 'Garmisch has no end of things to do and places to eat. We explored the beautiful Partnachklamm frozen waterfalls, climbed the wonderfully named Mount Wank, wandered the pretty streets, and ate as much as we could.'
