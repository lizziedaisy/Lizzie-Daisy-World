description1: 'Our first adventure of 2017 was to Rotterdam. We managed to pick a super rainy weekend, but the river views were pretty impressive in all the fog.'
description2: "We staye at an incredible hotel on the river, and were upgraded to a penthouse room. It was ultra modern - too fancy for our needs but we weren't complaining!"
description3: 'We went on a wander to find dinner and drinks. We found a gorgeous street lined with bars and went in and out of a few. One place was called Wonderbar, which was a gorgeous quirky venue with the best assortment of beers ever - I had two mango beers, which will be my favourite for the rest of my life now!'
